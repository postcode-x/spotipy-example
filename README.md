## Querying playlist tracks and features using Spotipy

[Tutorial](https://postcode-x.web.app/posts/conectarse-api-spotify-python/)

Use this Python script to query all the tracks and their correspondent audio features from a given Spotify playlist. The result will be stored as a JSON file inside the "data" folder, which you can eventually process in any way you want. You can easily modify this code to accept multiple playlists.

Note: Remember to set'myClientID' and 'myClientSecret' with your own credentials.
