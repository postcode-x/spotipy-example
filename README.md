## Querying playlist tracks and features using Spotipy

Use this Python script to query all the tracks and their correspondent audio features from a given Spotify playlist. The result will be stored as a JSON file in the "data" folder, which you can eventually process in any way you want. You can easily modify this code to accept multiple playlists.

Note: Remember to replace 'yourClientID' and 'yourClientSecret' with your own credentials.
